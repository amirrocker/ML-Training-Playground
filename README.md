# DeepQLearning
learning ground and play sandbox for python and machine learning.
This is a repository that is quite unorganized and wip still. 
A number of ideas and concepts are wildly thrown together with 
a sizable amount of digital garbage ):O 
A want to find some time soon to clean up this repo and sharpen the
focus of it :)

# DeepQLearning
learning ground and play sandbox for Deep Q Learning models
and ml. 
This is a beginner's playground to try stuff and play around with.
There is no serious project but simply a number of files that have 
been adding up over time as I have been reading books and tutorials on the web.

This repo is not structured, nor clean, 
But I will try to enforce order in this chaos over time.
